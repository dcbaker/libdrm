libdrm - userspace library for drm

This  is libdrm,  a userspace  library for  accessing the  DRM, direct
rendering  manager, on  Linux,  BSD and  other  operating systems that
support the  ioctl interface.  The library  provides wrapper functions
for the  ioctls to avoid  exposing the kernel interface  directly, and
for chipsets with drm memory manager, support for tracking relocations
and  buffers.   libdrm  is  a  low-level library,  typically  used  by
graphics drivers  such as the Mesa  DRI drivers, the  X drivers, libva
and  similar projects.  New  functionality in  the kernel  DRM drivers
typically requires  a new  libdrm, but a  new libdrm will  always work
with an older kernel.


Compiling
---------

libdrm is compiled using meson and ninja. The first step for building for a
tar-ball or from git is to configure, and set a build directory:

    meson build

By default, libdrm will install into the /usr/local/ prefix. If you
want to install this DRM to replace your system copy, pass
--prefix=/usr to meson, or -Dprefix=/usr to mesonconf.

Next step is to build libdrm:

	ninja -C build

and once make finishes successfully, install the package using

	ninja install

If you are installing into a system location, you will need to be root
to perform the install step.
